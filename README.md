# cardataset-cleaning
Welcome to my GitHub-repo !
This would be my first project on this platform and would like to brief you about.
This is a DATA-CLEANING & PRE-PROCESSING project, where i had worked on a cardataset csv file.
I have given a brief description of all the operations i performed in my editor.
The operations consists of :-  
-> Missing data handling with object & numeric data-types.
-> Handling Outliers using IQR & z-score (or direct) method.
-> Scaling of datas using Standardization & Normalization.
-> Removal of duplicate rows of datas.

Hope my FELLOW CODERS find my project helpful !!
Happy coding!
